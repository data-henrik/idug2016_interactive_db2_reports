Conference Website: [IDUG EMEA 2016](http://www.idug.org/p/cm/ld/fid=862)

### How to have fun with DB2 / dashDB and Jupyter Notebooks - interactive presentation and reports
My IDUG session E08 is about to following topics
   * Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks
   * Interfaces to DB2 / dashDB
   * Presentations with RISE
   * The FUN I had and more...

The draft for my IDUG EMEA presentation is in the file [20161115_IDUG_InteractiveReports.ipynb](https://github.com/data-henrik/idug2016_interactive_db2_reports/blob/master/20161115_IDUG_InteractiveReports.ipynb)

### Stuff I used
For my Jupyter Notebook-based presentation I made use of several products, libraries and technologies. Here is a list of those:
* DB2 and dashDB
* Jupyter Notebook: http://jupyter.org/
* SQL Magic / ipython-sql: https://github.com/catherinedevlin/ipython-sql
* RISE - Reveal.js Jupyter/IPython Slideshow Extension: https://github.com/damianavila/RISE
* ibmdbpy: http://pythonhosted.org/ibmdbpy/
* ibmdby sample notebooks: https://github.com/ibmdbanalytics/ibmdbpy-notebooks
* Python interface to DB2 - ibm_db: https://github.com/ibmdb/python-ibmdb
* Bokeh Visualization Library: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/
* ...

I started my journey with Jupyter Notebooks using the [Apache Spark service on Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/apache-spark/) which includes notebooks.
